/** This will serve as a platform for helper functions need for pagination features like sorting filtering as well as error handling
 * 
 * right now Plant.find({}) returns every plant that is fine with 12-50 records but that will be a disaster for scaling like 500000 records. we have talked about it already but you can load hundreds of megabytes into 1 response and the could be to a mobile device... that is not the way to go. Pagination makes the request a fixed predictable size no matter how big the collection grows to be, fixing the scaling issues
 * 
 * the other reason is every value has to be parsed that is coming from the database amd that can ;ead to high load and data usage time
 * 
 * by using pagination and request limits we can convert these value and use them for Mongoose and the requests
 * 
 * @param {object} query req.query
